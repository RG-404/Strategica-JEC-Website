                    'Scenario in India after COVID-19, with special reference to
                    tourism, and leadership qualities required for it'
                  </strong>{" "}
                  by <strong>Vivek Atray</strong> Our guest is an ex-IAS officer
                  and a TED speaker. He is the author of three books, titled
                  "Finding Success Within", "Move on Bunnyrand "Dubey Ji Bounces
                  Back". It was an amazing session as it was enlightening how
                  India's market size is humongous which holds a chance to
                  upgrade by inviting investors from other countries. "Tourism
                  has to be natural to a country", he says. Tourism sector can
                  be a success if and only if perception, facilitation,
                  security, sanitation, health is taken special care of. State
                  government must take the responsibility of making the state
                  exist in the eyes of the world. Apart from that the tourism
                  website must be user friendly and responsive to any queries
                  put to them. He says, "Leadership must be carried forth with
                  emotional intelligence.", to which I agree completely. There
                  must be a sense of empathy towards the people we are working
                  with. Last but not the least, the 8 Cs of success he stated -
                  Courage, Character, Creativity, Cheerfulnees, Compassion,
                  Contentment, Calmness, Communication - which must be kept in
                  mind in life and implemented.
