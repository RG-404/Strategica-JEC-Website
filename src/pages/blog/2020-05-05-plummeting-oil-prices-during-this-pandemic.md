An unusual catastrophe,a coronavirus pandemic, has put the world into a considerable lockdown hammering International travel,supply chains and production.This represents an unprecedented shock to global oil demand.Travel restrictions following public health crisis have reduced the global demand for oil and the absence of a new production agreement among OPEC+ members has led to a surfeit of oil supply.

In the past month oilfields have come to a halt, storage tanks have filled up in record time and national oil companies even briefly set about on a price war to try and win a wider margin of a shrinking market. US oil prices collapsed to negative territory for the first time in history as the evaporation of demand left the world awash with oil and not enough storage capacity.

Worldâ€™s largest oil-consuming nation, the US, has become self-sufficient in not only meeting its own domestic demand for oil but has also started exporting oil. It has become the single largest exporter of oil in the world, ahead of Saudi Arabia, who was until now, the largest producer and exporter of oil. Coronavirus has proven to be a death warrant for crude oil. This has created a long-lasting problem among OPEC and OPEC+ member nations.

 The Indian Basket -- a weighted average of Oman, Dubai, Brent Crude -- is an indicator of the price of Indian crude oil imports. It is currently at $20.56 per barrel, sharply lower than levels seen before.However, India does not benefit much from lower oil prices at the moment, especially as the entire nation has been kept under lockdown. With hardly any demand for oil, India already has its tanks full.

If the global lockdown continues for a few more months, global oil producers could be left in a pool of trouble.
