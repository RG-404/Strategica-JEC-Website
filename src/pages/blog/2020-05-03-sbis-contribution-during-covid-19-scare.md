Extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 3 will inflict an economic loss of USD 234.4 billion and results in stagnant GDP for calender year 2020, a brokerage said. The brokerage had said earlier that the three week lockdown would likely to have an economic cost of USD 120 billion which is now estimated to balloon upto USD 234.4 BILLION.

The country's largest lender State Bank of India said that it has raised USD 100 million green bonds, the first such bond by any state-owned bank in this fiscal. The bonds were priced at 3M Libor + 80 basis points.

Cash withdrawals from banks hit a 16-month high when the public withdraw Rs 53,000 crore during the fortnight ended March 13, according to the data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Such huge cash withdrawals are seen only during festivals or elections. The central bank, which supplies currency to the public via banking system, released an equivalent amount of cash over the fortnight. Total currency with the public was Rs 23 lakh crore as on March 13.

Even though digital transactions have been getting a push, econmists say that there tends to be a strong element of caution at times of such emergencies. Even as banks are promoting online transactions, some e-commerce firms such as Flipkart have stopped delivery services. As a result, a lot of buying that cannot be postponed has gone offline, requiring hard cash for transaction.

During a lockdown, most essential purchases tend to be in cash. *"An adequate supply of cash notes to bank needs to be ensured that can meet a sudden increase in the demand for liquidity"*, said S.K Ghosh, group chief economist at State Bank of India in a recent research note.

To help out its borrowers facing hardship due to the spread of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19, India's largest public sector lender State Bank of India has announced to make available additional credit facilities to the eligible existing borrowers by way of ad-hoc facilities i.e. COVID-19 Emergency Credit Line (CECL) to tide over the current crisis situation.

So, the existing SBI borrowers, facing difficulties due to stalled economic activities due to corona virus scare, may opt for the CECL, by way of SLC (Standby Letter of Credit ) till June 30, 2020. Holders of all standard accounts, which have not been classified as Standard Mention Account (SMA)1 or 2, are eligible to get the additional loan up to 10 per cent of the existing Fund Based Working Capital Limits (FBWC) with a maximum credit limit Rs 200 crore. The loan amount would be disbursed in one go and may be repaid in six equated monthly installments (EMIs) after a moratorium period of six months from the date of disbursement of the loan, with the option of extending the cover period of receivables by three months till closure of the facility.
