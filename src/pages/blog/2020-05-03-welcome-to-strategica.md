They say *"Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong  attempt to acquire it"*, and we as students should be the first ones to  imbibe this virtue. With this very idea in mind, some of our juniors from  the Batch of 2022 have come up with a prodigious and novel plan of establishing a club named **‘STRATEGICA’** in our college to inculcate the  spirit of research, innovative thinking and analytical knowledge amongst  the Joencovites.

It gives me immense pleasure to formally introduce the club to you all  with the launch of its website.

Here at Strategica, we work on four main  domains-

## 1. FINANCE

   Which includes workshops on stock markets, exchange trade,     investment, public finance, etc. And events on virtual trading challenges,     bidding wars, etc and social media initiatives likeFinec Weekend, etc.

## 2. ECONOMICS & CONSULTING

   This domain is meant for meeting the economic knowledge demands     and getting students exposed to real-time economic scenario through     events such as guest lectures on economic issues, budgeting, Industry     4.0, ideathons, ‘Policypher-an online decision-making, case-study,     data-visualisation and policy-making event’, ‘BudgetBuzz’, 
   impact-analysis studies, economic assesment of engineering.

## 3. RESEARCH

   The domain will cater to developing a temperament of research and     development in the college through activities such as oral presentation     competitions on special occasions and college fests like Intra-JEC     hackathons, ‘Nobel Sammelan’ - an in-house event to highlight and     discuss the Nobel Laureates’ works and weekly social media initiatives 
   like TechConnect, Techie Talkie, etc

## 4. ANALYTICS

   This is the data science sphere of the club with activities like workshops     on data analytics and competitions on data analysis and prediction analysis.<br/><br/>

This announcement is however incomplete without bringing out the     names of all those diligent and passionate students who have taken this     initiative and are rentlessly working hard to take the club to greater     heights; *Shreya Simanta Sarmah, Seemanta Shome, Mriganka Mandal, 
   Anurag Kashyap, Arpita Sarkar, Rishparn Gogoi, Subhranan Bora, 
   Parishmita Das, Akangshya Pathak, Bedabrat Talukdar.*

We are really proud to have such motivated juniors around, keep up the     good work.

 Opportunities are what we create out of the resources we have, this     club aims at providing you the chance to learn new things in the most     innovative and surreal way. I earnestly request everyone to follow the 
   club’s social media handles, participate in the various activities being 
   conducted and thereby make the motive of STRATEGICA a reality.

Thank you
