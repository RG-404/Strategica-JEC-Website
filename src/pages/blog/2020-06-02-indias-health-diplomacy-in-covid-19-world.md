In the recent times where the whole world is fighting with an invisible enemy which only gets stronger with time and shows no signs of abation, health service is one weapon in our arsenal which can help us combat it's spread and fight this dreaded disease. While many countries are fighting together hand in hand, some countries like Cuba and India have followed a noble pattern of medical diplomacy. Well it's not surprising for Cuba as it always relied on a strong medical education and infrastructure and sent support to not just Latin American countries and the Caribbean but also to countries across the world viz. Italy, India has supported the world with not just medical staff but a buffet of generic medicines,medical training and medical tourism. It's not the first time for India as India has a history of medical diplomacy and a robust system of medical and pharmaceutical but it decided to strengthen its medical human resource and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

**India is performing a herculean job in helping other countries by ---** 

**Delivering Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)** --- HCQ is an antimalarial drug which is seen as useful for people suffering from Corona virus. India has taken up the role of a world's pharmacy and is supplying medicines across the globe by expediting speedy export clearance to meet the explosion in demand for drugs viz HCQ, Paracetamol as a gift to developing countries and as export to countries who could afford them. Till now it has gifted 10 mn  HCQ and 1.32 mn Paracetamol to  26 and 15 countries respectively and exported 445 mn HCQ and 619 mn Paracetamol to 60 and 50 countries respectively. Many of these supplies were made through AirIndia and Indian Airforce flights.

**Humanitarian Assistance** --- India is not only helping other countries with generic medicines but also sending it's team of trained  military doctors to Nepal, Maldives, Kuwait to help the local administration there to draw up plan to combat the spread of SARS COV-2.

Through Operation Sanjeevani India has delivered around 6.2 tonnes of medicines and hospital supplies to the Maldives.

Essential supplies were also send to our extended neighbours on Indian ocean, West Asia, Central Asia and South America.

To various African countries like Uganda,Nigeria, Republic of combo etc India not only supplied HCQ and Paracetamol but also antibiotics such as Azithromycin, anti- diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-asthmatic  and cardiovascular drug along  with other  materials viz thermometers etc.

Adding to these, the MEA has coordinated massive incoming and outgoing evacuation exercises-not just of Indians. Till now the MEA has facilitated the evacuation of more than 58000 foreign nationals from India to other countries. These measures of India were appreciated by various world leaders such as Trump, Bolsonaro etc.

**Big Outreach** --- Prime minister Modi has been engaging with the leaders of the SAARC and the G-20 countries virtually to work towards a common global response to the pandemic.

Under the SAARC initiatives India activated it's "e-ITEC" Network through which Indian health care experts train the SAARC medical team for handling the pandemic. India also developed an information exchange platform named "Coinex" which facilitates online training and the use of digital resources on the key aspect about the pandemic. India also voluntarily contributed $10M to the "COVID-19 Emergency Fund".

**India is also collaborating with other countries for the development of vaccine ---**

* The Indian Immunologicals Limited collaborated with the Griffiths University of Australia to develop a vaccine.
* India is also collaborating with US in its  33 year old Vaccine Action Program. Under this the Indian Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is collaborating with the US based National Institute of Health (NIH).
* Bharat Biotech and Thomas Jefferson,an US based University is working to develop an experimental vaccine named "Coravax".

US AID, a US based agency is funding 200 ventilators to India and the Centre For Disease Control Of USA funded $3.6M to India for research purpose which is awaiting approval by the MHA.

India through its proactive measures and generosity has turned the worlds attention towards itself which will not only help to deepen the diplomatic ties with other countries but also the broaden the horizon of ties with countries such as the Middle East (this act of diplomacy would add another facet to a relationship which was previously based on energy security and diaspora).
