Very often, but this industry is known by various names. And I am glad and honored to share what I have experienced since the last one year. Yes, the industry which gave me *respect, a mindset to live the world high, a personality to sustain, freedom to financial independence and knowledge*- being a B. Tech. Civil Engineering student.

The industry is named **Network Marketing** and also has various synonyms due to lack of proper knowledge what we call as information or data. Namely- *Direct Selling, Multi Level Marketing (MLM), Chain Marketing, Pyramid Scheme, Business* and many more. Of course, as any other successful industry before it’s success, this industry was also blamed and lakhs of people were against, even had negative views towards it. Although it sustained then, and is now giving a well lifestyle living to many of the successful individuals produced by the industry since the last 50+ years.

The industry is basically ruined via two facts

1. **By The Unsuccessful Short-Term Individuals-**

    The individuals who after leaving this profession started rumoring it.. May be because of their unsuccessful past experiences from the industry or may be because they don’t want others to face the same failures they did

    **But, my dear friends, “Till The Time You Don’t Face Failures, You Don’t Get The Happiness Of SUCCESS”**. We learn from our failures or bad experiences to make our tomorrow a new and a better future. I too faced many failures in the first 3-6 months in this industry when I was a beginner. Just as, a student can’t teach while he/she is learning, I was a student of Network Marketing who was learning its basics and principles in the first 6 months and I tell you, this is an industry where there doesn’t exist any age restriction of learning. I have seen many people who are well in their respective profession, either he/she is a business men or a teacher in his/her profession has to learn and adopt the culture of Network Marketing.
2. **By The Unethical Companies Of This Industry-**

   Network Marketing is an industry which contains various different independent companies where each and every individual is eligible to opt the type and kind of “Network Marketing Company” they want to join and make out there fortune from it.

   This, is due to the **“Model Of Network Marketing”** which says if you promote any helpful products or consumer needed services and the other guy agrees to buy/purchase and use it, via just *“Mouth of Promotion”* one will get an incentive or commission for his/her that particular promotion. Also, if the other person does the same thing, then also the individual will be getting an incentive, which when counted on a network’s basis results massive earnings. When this model is executed with a team work or systematic work, one is able to earn a Passive & Compounded Income i.e., without even working an individual is able to have his/her daily and integrated income, just the fact is he/she have to create a strong unbreakable team or network of people who will be working against his work *(Mind the team members will be working for their successes).*

   Few Companies, taking advantage of this model and the faith of the persons, come with an unproductive product or services just with the power of Network Marketing Model, works for a couple of years(say 2-3 years or less) and **shuts it down at once** as soon as they get a profit out of it, for which many lose daily earnings & their targeted dreams/goals/hopes and has to work again from the beginning.

Keeping aside the negative views there are many advantages of doing Network Marketing specially at the age of 18-25. 

* Low Risk and High Chances of Success
* Experience of working before we enter the market. (Survival_Life_As_Many_Of_Our_Parents\_Lived\_&_Are_Living)
* Communication Skills, Public Speaking, Leadership Skills & Management Skills, Personality etc. are developed well and is a part of this industry.
* Selling, Objection Handling, Problem solving Attitude & Closing Skills are developed and enhanced with time which are the primary requirements to live in the society, which we have been doing since our childhood, but in a systematic way.
* It Is A Way To Start Up Opportunities (as one can generate & earn a massive income from here).
* And many more…. 

  Most importantly the process of Network Marketing Journey develops a mindset to think big and inspires young generations in the long run.

**Example:-** A Mango Tree

Just as to have a delightful outcome of bulk mangoes from a garden/farm of mango tree for decades, it requires harsh & massive systematic work for growing up the trees healthily for a year or so, Network Marketing as a profession requires 3-6 years to built up a network or an asset which works on behalf of him for the rest of the years.

**Successful Persons say- “If anyhow they are being bankrupt, they shall begin and continue from Networking” –Team work is something we need to understand and Network Marketing is something where without team work there is no work.**

NOTE- Thus, for those who don’t like to adopt working with team or group of people can never grow or achieve success over Network Marketing.
